If your headline sucks, no one will read your article.  Split test titles to find out which ones attract the most readers.

== Description ==

Newspaper editors have known for generations that a great headline sells papers.  If the headline sucks, then it doesn't matter how good the rest of the article is, because no one will read it.

Top newspapers like The Huffington Post now apply this principle to their online publications by testing different headlines for the same story, live on their website.

However, if you're not a multi-million dollar news corporation, you can't afford to develop proprietary testing systems.  That's why we created the Title Split Testing Plugin for WordPress so that you can do the same simple tests for FREE.

It enables you to create a number of different titles for each article, and randomly display different titles to different users to find out which title achieves the highest click-thorugh rates.   After a few hours of testing you can then select the best title to be shown to all visitors.  It also helps you to learn what type of titles get the best reaction from your readers.  Do they like short titles or long titles, funny titles or serious titles.  Take the guess work out of your article titles and use this plugin to measure real user behaviour.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to the plugin settings in the WordPress dashboard and define the maximum number of titles that you want to test on each post, and what types of pages, posts or cutom post types you want to enable the plugin on.
4. When you create a new post or page, you will see fields for additional titles.  Fill these in and check back later to see which ones have the highest conversion rate.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= What are the requirements for using the Title Split Testing Plugin? =
You need to have a WordPress site running version 3.3 or later.  It might work on older versions, but you'll have to test that and tell us.  You also need a website with a good amount of traffic because if you only have a handful of visitors a day then you won't have enough data to make good decisions regarding which titles are best.

= How does it work? =
You set up multiple competing titles for a page or post. Then when someone visits your website, it randomly shows different titles to different visitors and records the percentage of people that click on each title. When enough people have visited your website, you can compare the data to see which title had the highest percentage of people clicking through to read the full post/page.

You can then choose the winning title and the plugin will display that title to all visitors in future.

If you want to repeat a test, you can simply click the Reset Data button inside the post/page editor and start the testing all over again.

= How many different titles can I test at one time? =
You can test choose how many title variations you want to eb able to test in the plugin settings. We recommend 2 or 3 different titles but you can test more if you like.

= Can I edit the titles that I am testing part way through a test? =
Yes you can, but in order that the data is accurate you should click the Reset Data button to start the test again.

= Does it update the post URL? =
No. The post URL does not change when you test different titles, or when you select your final title. This is because you may have links pointing to that page/post and you may not want to change the URL for SEO reasons. If you want to change the post/page URL, you can do so manually just like normal in WordPress.

= Will readers get confused if the titles keep changing? =
No, the plugin displays different titles to different visitors, but each visitor will always see the same set of titles, so they will not be aware that you are split testing. Only after you have completed testing and chosen your winning title can readers see that the title changed. This will only happen if they previously saw a title that was NOT selected and they refresh their browser.

= Will Google get confused by the changing titles? =
No. The plugin only displays alternative titles to real website visitors using common web browsers. Google only sees the main title of your post/page and is not affected by the spit testing process until you choose the winning title following your test. When you do this, Google will just see this as if you updated the title manually and will index the new title.

= Why does the number of views appear higher than my actual site traffic? =
The plugin measures the number of &#34;Views&#34; based on the number of times a link to the target page is displayed on pages viewed by your visitors. Sometimes there can be multiple links to a post or page on the same page (such as footer and sidebar links), aswell as links that do not include the actual post title such as &#34;Read More&#34; links. All of these links are counted as &#34;Views&#34;.

We have found that for the majority of websites this does not have any siginifcant effect on determining the winning headline.

= Can the plugin update navigation links? =
No. The plugin is not able to update links unless they are dynamically generated by the post/page title. We ask that you use your judgement to decide whether your theme will allow accurate split testing.

= Does the plugin use Cookies? =
Yes, the plugin uses cookies to remember which title it has shown to which visitor, thereby ensuring that each user always sees the same title when they refresh the page.  Otherwise it could get really confusing.  You will however have to make a judgement about how this affects your compliance with the EU Cookie Law.
